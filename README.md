# Weather App

Since we are programmers and believe in automation, we would like to have an app to check the weather outside so we do not actually have to go outside to see what it's like.

## Environment Variables

Please see the contents `/src/env.d.ts` for required/optional environment variables.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
